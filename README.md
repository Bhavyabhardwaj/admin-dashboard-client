# Admin Dashboard Frontend  

This is the frontend of an **Admin Dashboard** application designed to manage users, roles, and permissions efficiently. The dashboard offers a secure and user-friendly interface, enabling administrators to handle key tasks such as user management, role definition, and permissions assignment.   

### **1. User Management**  
- View and manage a list of users.  
- Add, edit, or delete user accounts.  
- Assign roles to users and manage their status (e.g., Active/Inactive).  

### **2. Role Management**  
- Define new roles and edit existing ones.  
- Associate roles with specific permissions (e.g., Read, Write, Delete) or custom attributes.
